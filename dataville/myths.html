            <h2>Myths about Data Science</h2><br>
            <p>Data science has many advantages for modern organizations, but there is also a great deal of hype around it, so we 
                should understand what its limitations are. One of the biggest myths is the belief that data science is an autonomous 34 Chapter 1
                process that we can let loose on our data to find the answers 
                to our problems. In reality, data science requires skilled 
                human oversight throughout the different stages of the 
                process. Humans analysts are needed to frame the problem, to design and prepare the data, to select which ML 
                algorithms are most appropriate, to critically interpret the 
                results of the analysis, and to plan the appropriate action 
                to take based on the insight(s) the analysis has revealed. 
                Without skilled human oversight, a data science project 
                will fail to meet its targets. The best data science outcomes 
                occur when human expertise and computer power work 
                together, as Gordon Linoff and Michael Berry put it: “Data 
                mining lets computers do what they do best—dig through 
                lots of data. This, in turn, lets people do what people do 
                best, which is to set up the problem and understand the 
                results” (2011, 3).
                The widespread and growing use of data science 
                means that today the biggest data science challenge for 
                many organizations is locating qualified human analysts 
                and hiring them. Human talent in data science is at a 
                premium, and sourcing this talent is currently the main 
                bottleneck in the adoption of data science. To put this 
                talent shortfall in context, in 2011 a McKinsey Global 
                Institute report projected a shortfall in the United States 
                of between 140,000 and 190,000 people with data science and analytics skills and an even larger shortfall of 
                1.5 million managers with the ability to understand data What Is Data Science? 35
                science and analytics processes at a level that will enable 
                them to interrogate and interpret the results of data science appropriately (Manyika, Chui, Brown, et al. 2011). 
                Five years on, in their 2016 report, the institute remained 
                convinced that data science has huge untapped value potential across an expanding range of applications but that 
                the talent shortfall will remain, with a predicted shortfall 
                of 250,000 data scientists in the near term (Henke, Bughin, Chui, et al. 2016).
                The second big myth of data science is that every data 
                science project needs big data and needs to use deep learning. In general, having more data helps, but having the 
                right data is the more important requirement. Data science projects are frequently carried out in organizations 
                that have significantly less resources in terms of data 
                and computing power than Google, Baidu, or Microsoft. 
                Examples indicative of the scale of smaller data science 
                projects include claim prediction in an insurance company 
                that processes around 100 claims a month; student dropout prediction for a university with less than 10,000 students; membership dropout prediction for a union with 
                several thousand members. So an organization doesn’t 
                need to be handling terabytes of data or to have massive computing resources at its disposal to benefit from 
                data science.</p>
