            <h2>A History of Data Analysis</h2><br>
            <p>Statistics is the branch of science that deals with the collection and analysis of data. The term statistics originally 
                referred to the collection and analysis of data about the 
                state, such as demographics data or economic data. However, over time the type of data that statistical analysis 
                was applied to broadened so that today statistics is used 
                to analyze all types of data. The simplest form of statistical analysis of data is the summarization of a data set in 
                terms of summary (descriptive) statistics (including measures of a central tendency, such as the arithmetic mean, or 
                measures of variation, such as the range). However, in the 
                seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the work of people 
                such as Gerolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal, Jakob Bernoulli, 
                Abraham de Moivre, Thomas Bayes, and Richard Price 
                laid the foundations of probability theory, and through 
                the nineteenth century many statisticians began to use 
                probability distributions as part of their analytic tool kit. 
                These new developments in mathematics enabled statisticians to move beyond descriptive statistics and to start 12 Chapter 1
                doing statistical learning. Pierre Simon de Laplace and Carl 
                Friedrich Gauss are two of the most important and famous 
                nineteenth-century mathematicians, and both made important contributions to statistical learning and modern 
                data science. Laplace took the intuitions of Thomas Bayes 
                and Richard Price and developed them into the first version of what we now call Bayesâ€™ Rule. Gauss, in his search 
                for the missing dwarf planet Ceres, developed the method 
                of least squares, which enables us to find the best model 
                that fits a data set such that the error in the fit minimizes 
                the sum of squared differences between the data points in 
                the data set and the model.</p>
