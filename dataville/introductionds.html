            <h2>What is data science</h2><br>
            <p>Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem 
                definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting nonobvious and useful patterns from large data sets. Many 
                of the elements of data science have been developed in 
                related fields such as machine learning and data mining. 
                In fact, the terms data science, machine learning, and data 
                mining are often used interchangeably. The commonality 
                across these disciplines is a focus on improving decision 
                making through the analysis of data. However, although 
                data science borrows from these other fields, it is broader 
                in scope. Machine learning (ML) focuses on the design 
                and evaluation of algorithms for extracting patterns from 
                data. Data mining generally deals with the analysis of 
                structured data and often implies an emphasis on commercial applications. Data science takes all of these considerations into account but also takes up other challenges, 2 Chapter 1
                such as the capturing, cleaning, and transforming of 
                unstructured social media and web data; the use of bigdata technologies to store and process big, unstructured 
                data sets; and questions related to data ethics and 
                regulation. </p><br>
               <p> Using data science, we can extract different types of 
                patterns. For example, we might want to extract patterns 
                that help us to identify groups of customers exhibiting 
                similar behavior and tastes. In business jargon, this task 
                is known as customer segmentation, and in data science 
                terminology it is called clustering. Alternatively, we might 
                want to extract a pattern that identifies products that are 
                frequently bought together, a process called associationrule mining. Or we might want to extract patterns that 
                identify strange or abnormal events, such as fraudulent 
                insurance claims, a process known as anomaly or outlier 
                detection. Finally, we might want to identify patterns that 
                help us to classify things. For example, the following rule 
                illustrates what a classification pattern extracted from 
                an email data set might look like: If an email contains the 
                phrase “Make money easily,” it is likely to be a spam email.
                Identifying these types of classification rules is known as 
                prediction.</p>
