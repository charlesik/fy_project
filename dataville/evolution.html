            <h2>The Emergence and Evolution of Data Science</h2><br>
            <p>The term data science came to prominence in the late 1990s 
                in discussions relating to the need for statisticians to join 
                with computer scientists to bring mathematical rigor to 
                the computational analysis of large data sets. In 1997, 
                C. F. Jeff Wu’s public lecture “Statistics = Data Science?” 
                highlighted a number of promising trends for statistics, 
                including the availability of large/complex data sets in 
                massive databases and the growing use of computational 
                algorithms and models. He concluded the lecture by calling for statistics to be renamed “data science.”
                In 2001, William S. Cleveland published an action plan 
                for creating a university department in the field of data 
                science (Cleveland 2001). The plan emphasizes the need 
                for data science to be a partnership between mathematics 
                and computer science. It also emphasizes the need for data 
                science to be understood as a multidisciplinary endeavor 18 Chapter 1
                and for data scientists to learn how to work and engage 
                with subject-matter experts. In the same year, Leo Breiman published “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” 
                (2001). In this paper, Breiman characterizes the traditional approach to statistics as a data-modeling culture 
                that views the primary goal of data analysis as identifying 
                the (hidden) stochastic data model (e.g., linear regression) 
                that explains how the data were generated. He contrasts 
                this culture with the algorithmic-modeling culture that 
                focuses on using computer algorithms to create prediction 
                models that are accurate (rather than explanatory in terms 
                of how the data was generated). Breiman’s distinction between a statistical focus on models that explain the data 
                versus an algorithmic focus on models that can accurately 
                predict the data highlights a core difference between statisticians and ML researchers. The debate between these 
                approaches is still ongoing within statistics (see, for example, Shmueli 2010). In general, today most data science 
                projects are more aligned with the ML approach of building accurate prediction models and less concerned with 
                the statistical focus on explaining the data. So although 
                data science became prominent in discussions relating 
                to statistics and still borrows methods and models from 
                statistics, it has over time developed its own distinct approach to data analysis.</p>
