            <h2>A DATA SCIENCE ECOSYSTEM</h2><br>
            <p>The set of technologies used to do data science varies 
                across organizations. The larger the organization or the 
                greater the amount of data being processed or both, 
                the greater the complexity of the technology ecosystem 
                supporting the data science activities. In most cases, this 
                ecosystem contains tools and components from a number 
                of different software suppliers, processing data in many 
                different formats. There is a spectrum of approaches from 
                which an organization can select when developing its own 
                data science ecosystem. At one end of the spectrum, the 
                organization may decide to invest in a commercial integrated tool set. At the other end, it might build up a bespoke ecosystem by integrating a set of open-source tools 
                and languages. In between these two extremes, some 
                software suppliers provide solutions that consist of a mixture of commercial products and open-source products. 70 Chapter 3
                However, although the particular mix of tools will vary 
                from one organization to the next, there is a commonality 
                in terms of the components that are present in most data 
                science architectures.
                Figure 6 gives a high-level overview of a typical data 
                architecture. This architecture is not just for big-data 
                environments, but for data environments of all sizes. In 
                this diagram, the three main areas consist of data sources, 
                where all the data in an organization are generated; data 
                storage, where the data are stored and processed; and applications, where the data are shared with consumers of 
                these data.
                All organizations have applications that generate 
                and capture data about customers, transactions, and operational data on everything to do with how the organization operates. Such data sources and applications include 
                customer management, orders, manufacturing, delivery, 
                invoicing, banking, finance, customer-relationship management (CRM), call center, enterprise resource planning 
                (ERP) applications, and so on. These types of applications 
                are commonly referred to as online transaction processing
                (OLTP) systems. For many data science projects, the data 
                from these applications will be used to form the initial input data set for the ML algorithms. Over time, the volume 
                of data captured by the various applications in the organization grows ever larger and the organization will start 
                to branch out to capture data that was ignored, wasn’t  A Data Science Ecosystem 71

                captured previously, or wasn’t available previously. These 
                newer data are commonly referred to as “big-data sources” 
                because the volume of data that is captured is significantly 
                higher than the organization’s main operational applications. Some of the common big-data sources include 
                network traffic, logging data from various applications, 
                sensor data, weblog data, social media data, website data, 
                and so on. In traditional data sources, the data are typically stored in a database. However, because the applications associated with many of the newer big-data sources 
                are not primarily designed to store data long term—for 
                example, with streaming data—the storage formats and 
                structures for this type of data vary from application to 
                application.</p>
