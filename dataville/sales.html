            <h2>Data Science in Sales and Marketing</h2><br>
            <p>Walmart has access to large data sets about its customers’ 
                preferences by using point-of-sale systems, by tracking 
                customer behavior on the Walmart website, and by tracking social media commentary about Walmart and its products. For more than a decade, Walmart has been using data 
                science to optimize the stock levels in stores, a well-known 
                example being when it restocked strawberry Pop-Tarts 
                in stores in the path of Hurricane Francis in 2004 based 
                on an analysis of sales data preceding Hurricane Charley, which had struck a few weeks earlier. More recently, 
                Walmart has used data science to drive its retail revenues 
                in terms of introducing new products based on analyzing 
                social media trends, analyzing credit card activity to make 
                product recommendations to customers, and optimizing 
                and personalizing customers’ online experience on the 
                Walmart website. Walmart attributes an increase of 10 to 
                15 percent in online sales to data science optimizations 
                (DeZyre 2015).
                The equivalent of up-selling and cross-selling in the 
                online world is the “recommender system.” If you have 26 Chapter 1
                watched a movie on Netflix or purchased an item on Amazon, you will know that these websites use the data they 
                collect to provide suggestions for what you should watch 
                or buy next. These recommender systems can be designed 
                to guide you in different ways: some guide you toward 
                blockbusters and best sellers, whereas others guide you 
                toward niche items that are specific to your tastes. Chris 
                Anderson’s book The Long Tail (2008) argues that as production and distribution get less expensive, markets shift 
                from selling large amounts of a small number of hit items 
                to selling smaller amounts of a larger number of niche 
                items. This trade-off between driving sales of hit or niche 
                products is a fundamental design decision for a recommender system and affects the data science algorithms 
                used to implement these systems.</p>
