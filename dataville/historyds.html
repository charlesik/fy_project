            <h2>A Brief History of Data Science</h2><br>
            <p>The earliest methods for recording data may have been 
                notches on sticks to mark the passing of the days or poles 
                stuck in the ground to mark sunrise on the solstices. With 
                the development of writing, however, our ability to record our experiences and the events in our world vastly 
                increased the amount of data we collected. The earliest 
                form of writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3200 
                BC and was used for commercial record keeping. This type What Is Data Science? 7
                of record keeping captures what is known as transactional 
                data. Transactional data include event information such 
                as the sale of an item, the issuing of an invoice, the delivery of goods, credit card payment, insurance claims, and 
                so on. Nontransactional data, such as demographic data, 
                also have a long history. The earliest-known censuses took 
                place in pharaonic Egypt around 3000 BC. The reason that 
                early states put so much effort and resources into large 
                data-collection operations was that these states needed to 
                raise taxes and armies, thus proving Benjamin Franklin’s 
                claim that there are only two things certain in life: death 
                and taxes.
                In the past 150 years, the development of the electronic sensor, the digitization of data, and the invention 
                of the computer have contributed to a massive increase 
                in the amount of data that are collected and stored. A 
                milestone in data collection and storage occurred in 1970 
                when Edgar F. Codd published a paper explaining the relational data model, which was revolutionary in terms of 
                setting out how data were (at the time) stored, indexed, 
                and retrieved from databases. The relational data model 
                enabled users to extract data from a database using simple 
                queries that defined what data the user wanted without 
                requiring the user to worry about the underlying structure 
                of the data or where they were physically stored. Codd’s 
                paper provided the foundation for modern databases and 
                the development of structured query language (SQL), an 8 Chapter 1
                international standard for defining database queries. Relational databases store data in tables with a structure of 
                one row per instance and one column per attribute. This 
                structure is ideal for storing data because it can be decomposed into natural attributes</p>
